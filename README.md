# TrendFlow Trading Strategy

## Overview
TrendFlow is a technical indicator designed to identify market trends and potential reversal points. When combined with market news sentiment (bullish or bearish), it creates a powerful framework for predicting price direction.

## How TrendFlow Works
The TrendFlow indicator in `trendflow.pine` consists of:
1. **Trend Detection** - Uses a 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) to determine the current trend
2. **Background Color** - Green background indicates uptrend, red background indicates downtrend
3. **Trend Flip Signals** - Green dots appear when price crosses above SMA (bullish), red dots appear when price crosses below SMA (bearish)

## Combining TrendFlow with News
When TrendFlow signals align with relevant market news, trading opportunities with higher probability emerge:

### Bullish Scenarios
- **Strong Buy Signal**: TrendFlow shows a green dot (price crossing above SMA) + positive news catalyst
- **Trend Confirmation**: Existing green background (uptrend) + positive news reinforces upward momentum
- **Reversal Warning**: Despite red background (downtrend), a green dot + positive news may signal trend reversal

### Bearish Scenarios
- **Strong Sell Signal**: TrendFlow shows a red dot (price crossing below SMA) + negative news catalyst
- **Trend Confirmation**: Existing red background (downtrend) + negative news reinforces downward momentum
- **Reversal Warning**: Despite green background (uptrend), a red dot + negative news may signal trend reversal

## Implementation Strategy
1. Monitor TrendFlow indicator for trend status and potential flip signals
2. Track relevant news sources for market-moving information
3. Look for confluence between technical signals and fundamental news
4. Consider position sizing based on strength of confluence
5. Set stop losses based on the most recent trend flip point

## Risk Management
Always remember that even strong technical signals combined with news can fail. Use proper risk management and position sizing for each trade.
